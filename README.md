# 100-Days-Of-Hacking
Inspired by the #100DaysOfCode challenge, but focusing of cybersecurity, systems, network and so much more !

My goal during this '100 days of Hacking' challenge is to continue learning about web application vulnerabilities, and not only how to exploit them but how to prevent them! I look forward to sharing each week what I have learned in order to spread more awareness about what steps a developer should take to ensure the safety and security of data.


To hold myself accountable to my goals and in case anyone wants to join in on the '100 Days of Hacking' challenge, here are the rules that I have set up for myself:

Sunday- Tuesday: 40 minutes daily of learning about a specific vulnerability for the week (utilize purchased books, Port-Swigger, Pentester-Lab, Tryhackme, Hack-The-Box, ... etc). Keep notes daily on what was learned.

Friday: 4 hours to finish up learning whatever topic that I was learning in the middle of the week. Search for bugs in a real application, specifically ones related to the vulnerability learned during the week.

Saturday: 4 hours to search for bugs open to any vulnerabilities learned up to this point. Write a blog post about what I've learned and/or found during this week.

Goal by end of 100 days of hacking: FIND A BUG & RECEIVE A BOUNTY! üêõ üíª
